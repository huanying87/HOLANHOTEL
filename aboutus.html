    <h1>OUR STORY</h1>
    <p>HOLAN HOTEL has a long history. It was established in July 2023.
       Our five founders, commonly known as "HOLAN MEMBER" are committed to making those who don't 
       know why they come to HOLAN feel at home. At the same time, they like the sun, and they hope to 
       convey their love to more people, so they established this HOTEL and their slogan 
       "We are the people closest to the sun."</p></div>
